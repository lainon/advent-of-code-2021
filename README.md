## day-1 

Happy to start my first attempt at this journey. I do not know if I will complete it, but I am grateful that the first day's challenge was straightforward and fun. I hope I have the motivation to continue when things get rough!

## day-2

I found this day's challenge to be slightly easier than day one's. This challenge gave me an opportunity to try the pattern matching introduced in Python 3.10, as well as to modify a function's behavior based on the calling function. 

## day-3 

I am happy with my recursive solution to this problem. I am beginning to notice that part 1 of each solution ought to be used to help solve part 2. In other words, part 1 -- at least to this point -- has always been a subset of the problem in part 2. 

## day-4

Soon...
